Open Edisu is an unofficial open-source app created created with the aim of proposing an alternative to the critical issues of the official Edisu app [Campus Piemonte](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=it.astutesoftwares.edisu).

## Q&A 
#### Why did you do it?
I lost a lot of time and fingertips scrolling through the booking view of the official app during the 2021/2022 universitary winter session. I knew the issue wasn't Edisu itself but the booking view of their official app. As soon as the session ended, I started thinking about creating an alternative client to book the Edisu study room.

#### Do you earn anything from it?
No, I don't. I developed it for myself and I'm just happy to share it.

#### I would like to see XYZ feature implemented...
Open an issue! I'll have a look asap!

#### Oh no, I found a bug!
Ugh... It happens sometimes... Open an issue and I'll fix it!
